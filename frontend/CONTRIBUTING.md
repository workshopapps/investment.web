## IMPORTANT!!! : OPEN YOUR PULL REQUESTS ON `dev` BRANCH, NOT `main` 

- #### Commiting your changes

  Now, you can start making changes that relates to your issues and then commiting them. To do this, follow these instructions:

  - First, create a branch with the feat prefixing the name of the feature you are to implement.
  - For example, do this by running `git checkout -b feat/FE-1-company-profile`
  - Make your changes.
  - add the changes using `git add .` or any one that serves your needs.
  - add concise commit messages, referencing your issue number with a close action.
    > e.g `git commit -m "feat(FE-1): added the company profile page"` 
    >
    > What this mean is that, when the PR leads merge your pull request (More on that below). Issue #21 is automatically closed.
  - run `git push origin [name of the repo you created]`
    > For the example above, you run
    >
    > `git push origin feat/signup`
    >
    > Which pushes your changes to your online copy, after which you then open a pull request.
  - Here is a [Video](https://youtu.be/VY4-yw7dbY8) showing how to perform that.

- #### Opening Pull requests

  Now that you have updated your online copy. You will need a way to inform the PR Leads handling the original repository that your contribution is ready. To do that, you open a Pull request, which simply means that you want them to combine(merge) your changes with that of the original repository. Because, what is the essence of making changes without the changes being merged right?

  To open a pull request, immediately after the last step (commiting your changes with push):

  - Head over to your github account. And click on your own copy of the zc_main repository.
  - You will see the option to open a pull request.
  - Create your pull request with the title `feat(FE-1): My PR adds a feature` 
  - Explain what your changes does, adding images and proof (test) if needed.
  - Click the open pull request button and wait.
  - Add comments where neccesary and wait for the PR Leads to check.
    Here is a [Video](https://youtu.be/3_LgvC0-Om4) showing how to go about it.

- #### Constantly update from upstream

  Now that you have your issues, you have forked the repository, you have cloned the repository and also set the upstream. To stay up to date and avoid conflicts. Before you edit anything, you need to update your local copy. Therefore, whenever you want to make any change, first run an update command like so:

  - In the directory of the project on your local machine
  - Open the terminal.
  - Run `git pull upstream main`
    > This will check for any changes that have been made to the original repository, it will then bring those changes to your local machine and merge (merge) the changes.


### Commit Messages

Commit messages should include concise messages about what was done and what has changed. Failure to follow this would result in the pull request being rejected.


## Other Information
