            For any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or other damages of any kind, including but not limited to lost profits, trading losses, damages resulting from the use or loss of use of the platform and third-party content, inconvenience, or delay, Yieldvest will not be liable to you or anyone else. This holds even if the business has been aware of the potential for such losses or damages. Yieldvest will not be responsible to you or anyone else for any loss brought on by a factor over which it has no direct control, such as ACTS OF GOD OR FORCE MAJEURE . Excessive or unusual weather, such as floods or earthquakes, fire, war, assassinations, terrorist acts, riots, labor disputes, and other labor issues, accidents, emergencies, or government actions, are examples of what this includes. It includes unauthorized access, viruses, theft, operator errors, and other unanticipated events. Failure of mechanical, electronic, or communication systems, including the internet, cable, and telephone, is also included. Suppose you reside in a jurisdiction where the exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages is prohibited. In that case, some or all of the above-mentioned limitations and exclusions may not apply to you.
